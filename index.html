                <p>I am a software engineer that lives in New Zealand.</p>

                <p>I studied at Victoria University, and with my time there I participated in a large range of software projects, 
                    some of which are on this page. I have worked for Beca and Greater Wellington
                Regional Council, as a Software Engineering Intern. </p>

                <p>In my spare time I like to explore the awesome reserves scattered around Wellington trying to find
                    bird life and
                    trees. I also like to read about digital currencies and economies, such as crytocurrencies, video
                    game item economies
                    and other trading based ecosystems.</p>

                        <p> Coming to the end of my time with the BEVis project, I realised that the design of the codebase was limiting my
                            feature development. In order to rectify this, I planned a transition to React and Redux to reduce the complexity
                            of the code, and enable refactoring and reuse of more of the code developed for the project.
                        </p>
    
                        <p> BEVFERLE is the product of ~40 hours development and planning time. BEVFERLE uses React components on the front end,
                            Redux to handle state, Python with Flask for a backend API that can provide data from MongoAtlas, and D3 to create 
                            visualisations. 
                        </p>
    
                        <p> BEVFERLE is an ongoing project of mine, and the codebase is available on my Gituhb 
                            (<a href="https://github.com/chriswtodd/BusEmissionsVis/">BEVFERLE Main</a>). Another advantage to this refactor is
                            the ability to reuse code, such as the 
                            <a href="https://observablehq.com/@chriswtodd/stream-graph-implementation-with-javascript-mixins">pure D3 implementations of the stream graph</a>.

                            bus public transport network. The model used for a data source was created by 2 software development interns and 
                            myself at Greater Wellington over the 2020 summer.

                            and gain insights from it. One of many goals with the project is to aid planners with replacing vehicles with 
                            electrics. These tools are intended to facilitate insights related to 3 major user tasks in the system:

                    <p>Network Resilience was a two part research project that investigated the performance of rural and

                        transport networks. I worked on mainly the urban tool, and contributed to the other project

                        buttons, confusing and
                        hidden operations, and a lack of guidance for the user. We looked at how we could improve the
                        experience of
                        all users from
                        lecturers to students. This project was a group project, undertaken with 5 other group members.

                    <p>We used Jakob Nielsens Discount Usability Engineer concepts to guide the development of features
                        neccessary
                        for revision. This
                        included development of personas, use cases and usability evaluation tests with heuristics.</p>
