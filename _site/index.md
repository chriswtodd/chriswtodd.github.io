My name is Chris, and I'm a software engineer. This is a personal GitHub page where I keep projects I've
worked on that I'd like to share with the world.

If you haven't already, see other projects of mine on [GitHub](https://github.com/chriswtodd/)

## About Me

I am a software engineer that lives in New Zealand.

## Projects

I have worked on a vast array of projects before, mainly Java and Electronics related. Below are some 
of the projects I have participated in.

### Traffic Visualization
#### Network Resilience

Traffic Visualisation has been an ongoing collaboration between VUW and Beca Group Ltd. There are many 
goals of the research, one of these is to better quantify the performance of a transport network.

Network Resilience was a two part research project that investigated the performance of rural and urban 
transport networks. I worked on mainly the urban tool, and contributed to the other project occassionally.

The urban tool creates a visualisation of [isochrones](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Isochrone) to 
show the change in commuter travel time depending on time of day. An example of isochrones that can be 
created with this tool are below.

Example Isochrone Image:

_This is an image of bus traffic (left) vs car traffic (right) of time taken on average to travel from the
'centre' of Auckland city on Thursday to various parts of the region. The animation runs between 9am-5pm_

[A project report in the form of a poster is available here](/pdfs/Traffic Network Resilience - Summer 
Gold Poster.pdf). This poster was created to communicate the motivation and goals of the research to 
tertiary level students to generate interest in the projects.

### Sports Data Visualization
#### The ANZ Championship

As a short university project, I created some visualizations using the D3.js library to take a deeper look
at some of the results of the games that were played in the ANZ Championship between 2008-2013.

I decided to focus on team performance for each game, for each year. Using the visualizations I designed,
one can find interesting relationships between teams with similar patterns of play, performance in the tournament and more.

Two of the Visualisations on this Page:

_This is an example of the Dot Chart and Heat Map. The charts display teams on the x-axis, and a 
performance metric on the y (eg points, acquired at a rate of 2 per win for the dot charts y-axis)._

### Creating Better Interfaces
#### Designing a Learning Management System

The learning manangement systems that we use at university are rather unfriendly to the user. Several repeat buttons, confusing and 
hidden operations, and a lack of guidance for the user. We looked at how we could improve the experience of all users from
lecturers to students. This project was a group project, undertaken with 5 other group members.

The landing page:
![Whiteboard](/images/White-vs-Black.png "Whiteboard landing")
_This is the Whiteboard landing page (left, our project), compared with the interface we were trying to improve on (right)._

We used Jakob Nielsens Discount Usability Engineer concepts to guide the development of features neccessary for revision. This 
included development of personas, use cases and usability evaluation tests with heuristics.
