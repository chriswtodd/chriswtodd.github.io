Kia ora, ko Chris ahau, a ko ahau pumanawa rorohiko matai puhanga. 

My name is Chris, and I'm a software engineer. This is a personal GitHub page where I keep projects I've
worked on that I'd like to share with the world.

If you haven't already, see other projects of mine on [GitHub](https://github.com/chriswtodd/)

## About Me

I am a software engineer that lives in New Zealand.

## Projects

I have worked on a vast array of projects before, mainly Java and Electronics related. Below are some 
of the projects I have participated in.

### Traffic Visualisation
#### Network Resilience

Traffic Visualisation has been an ongoing collaboration between VUW and Beca Group Ltd. There are many 
goals of the research, one of these is to better quantify the performance of a transport network.

Network Resilience was a two part research project that investigated the performance of rural and urban 
transport networks. I worked on mainly the urban tool, and contributed to the other project occassionally.

The urban tool creates a visualisation of [isochrones](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Isochrone) to 
show the change in commuter travel time depending on time of day. An example of isochrones that can be 
created with this tool are below.

Example Isochrone Image:

_This is an image of bus traffic (left) vs car traffic (right) of time taken on average to travel from the
'centre' of Auckland city on Thursday to various parts of the region. The animation runs between 9am-5pm_

A project report in the form of a poster is available [here](/pdfs/Traffic Network Resilience - Summer 
Gold Poster.pdf). This poster was created to communicate the motivation and goals of the research to 
tertiary level students to generate interest in the projects.
